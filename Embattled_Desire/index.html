<p>	    A land of hope,
<br />	Covered in ashes,
<br />	Swept away by fear,
<br />	Forgotten in tears,
<br />	Surrounded by ghost. <br />
<br />	Shall we ever return to our land of hope?
<br />	Will our children only dream of it?
<br />	And our babies sleep to its lullabies,
<br />	As we thread through this hazardous path to safety,
<br />	May we never forget our land of hope. <br />
<br />	Towards an uncertain future,
<br />	With a desire to survive our generation,
<br />	A desire for peace,
<br />	A desire to always return,
<br />	A desire to tell our stories. <br />
<br />	May we never experience such again,
<br />	Nor our children witness the horror of a feigned salvation,
<br />	God bless Nigeria,
<br />	God bless Africa,
<br />   God bless all the Continents.
